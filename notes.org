* generate w3c xml schema from relax ng compact schema
  1. modify rnc files that refer to dateTime but don't define it (ApiKeyPayload.rnc)
     : dateTime = \string
  2. simplify schema to remove externalRefs
     : for i in *.rnc; do java -jar ~/Downloads/jing-20090818/bin/jing.jar -sc $i > $(basename $i .rnc).rng; echo $? $i; done
  3. convert rng files to xsd
     : for i in *.rng; do java -jar ~/Downloads/trang-20091111/trang.jar $i $(basename $i .rng).xsd; done

* generate generateDS files
  : for f in CustomerPayload.xsd NetPayload.xsd DelegationPayload.xsd PocPayload.xsd OrgPayload.xsd ErrorPayload.xsd TicketedRequestPayload.xsd; do generateDS.py -a '' --namespacedef='xmlns="http://www.arin.net/regrws/core/v1"' -o $(basename $f xsd)py -s my$(basename $f xsd)py $f; done

* rws advantages over e-mail templates
  1. rDNS delegation
  2. direct, automatic error detection

* testing & evaluation issues
  - net get reallocated
  - reassign/reallocate

* README
  - generateDS module names
  - HTTPS caveat (with source address)
  - dependencies
    + python 2.7 (argparse, HTTPConnection)
  - not python 3.x
  - can't include early commits because of api key

* agenda
  - [ ] argparse
    - description
  - [ ] merge each set of resource programs into one
  - [X] check for apikey.py
  - [X] input from template
    + source ip :: -s
    + api key :: -k
    + handle :: positional arg (get, delete)
    + template file :: positional arg (create)
  - [X] test restful error handling
  - [ ] delegation
  - [X] valueOf_
  - [ ] why is poc get payload displayed as phone?
  - [ ] review imports (e.g. no need to import requests, sys?)
  - [X] template parsing module
  - [X] just alpha2 country code?
  - [X] poc template comments
  - [ ] regrws logging
  - [X] DictFromTemplate instead of DictFromTemplateFile
  - [X] subclass PayloadFromDict
  - [ ] normalize input/output payload identifiers
